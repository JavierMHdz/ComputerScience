c) What have you done in the assignment?
I have done a software implementation of CRC and Checksum. Furthermore, I have compared
the performance of CRC to Checksum, to see which method is more accurate. CRC is more
accurate than Checksum.
d)
crc_tx.cpp: I did the CRC for the transmitter side. I read the data and
the generator, at the end I append the remainder to the data, making it a
codeword.
crc_rx.cpp: I did the CRC for the receiver side. I read the data, then I did
the same CRC XOR operation as in crc_tx.cpp and compared if the codeword
had any errors.
crc_vs_checksum.cpp: I did both receiver and transmitter side of CRC and
Checksum, then compared their performance. Unfortunately, this file does not yield
the desired output in the checksum part of the project. I believe I did not implement
properly my checksum. However, I want to get feedback on what I did wrong and how can
I improve, so I can learn from my mistakes and not repeat the same mistake next time
I implement checksum.
Makefile: It compiles all the *.cpp files in the folder.
g) My program would fail if the random bit errors would flip the numbers in
such a way that neither the CRC nor the Checksum method might detect the error.um Also,
it would fail if the checksum ends up being the same in the receiver side as the sent
checksum, but there are errors in the data, but the errors cannot be
detected.
h) I used the ideas from www.geeksforgeeks.org to be able to convert from binary
decimal and decimal to binary. This function are in the crc_vs_checksum.cpp file
with the functions called "decimalNum()" and "binaryNum()".
